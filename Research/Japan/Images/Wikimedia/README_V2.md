# 1 file couldn't be uploaded here (obsolete)

Update: I am able to upload the file. All info below (except for line 12) is now null and void.

1 file couldn't be uploaded here (`150504_Ritsurin_Park_Takamatsu_Kagawa_pref_Japan01s3.jpg`) as it exceeds the GitHub 25 megabyte upload limit. As the JPG format is already highly compressed, I was unable to get the file size any lower.

You can view the file [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:150504_Ritsurin_Park_Takamatsu_Kagawa_pref_Japan01s3.jpg)

It seems like I may be able to upload it, due to GitHub using 25 MiB and not 25 MB. I will try. If it doesn't work, you will know, as the image won't be here.
