## Info

This project is for listing info about my experience with Anime, along with discussion.

[See my Anime listings](/Media/)

## Notes

1. Anime can cause a weird mood change in less than 2 minutes of viewing, with increased instability and some nausea for the next 4-18 hours (happened twice as of March 6th 2021) - As of March 8th 2021, I have noted that when watching for consecutive days in a row, the nausea effect is gone on day 2 and above

2. Anime can reset my mood.

3. I watch Anime extremely infrequently (less than 4 times a year, as of 2021) update March 8th 2021: this has changed

4. No other notes currently available

## Anime watchlist

Here is a list of Anime I have watched:

1. Sonic X: up to season 3 episode 1, stopped watching for 3-4 years, started over, watched 7 episodes, haven't watched since (first Anime watched)

2. Pokémon (anime) - I recently remembered that I have viewed this in the past. It was on in the background when I was younger, and I didn't pay too much attention to it, so I didn't notice most things. I never really got into Pokémon (neither the game or the show) unknown watch statistics

3. Namakura Gotana - Watched in full once

4. Assasination classroom: only watched episode 1, English dubbed

5. Konosuba: Only the first episode, subtitles on, along with various clips. Unable to access episode 2 and onward

6. Other anime/animemes: have not watched yet, only clips

<!-- **Rate of watching: extremely rare (less than 4 times a year, as of 2021)** !-->

**Rate of watching: extremely rare (less than ~20 times a year, as of March 8th 2021)**

## Weeaboo

I specifically have learned to limit my obsessions with certain things due to extremists like Weeaboos. This is part of the reason why I limit how much Japanese I can learn per year, along with how much Anime I watch. I still enjoy it, I just have to make sure it doesn't become an obsession or a huge embarrassment.

## Waifu

See above. This is a bit extreme, so I am not going to participate in it. I do not have a Waifu, nor do I plan to. The idea seems stupid to me.

When watching subbed Anime, I noted that I am able to both read the English subtitles and translate certain Japanese words (the ones that are in a format where I can understand, other than the 12 Japanese words I already knew) at the same time.

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
